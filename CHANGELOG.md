# Upcoming
* Encode `CompactStr` in such a way that `size_of::<CompactStr>() == size_of::<Option<CompactStr>>()`
    * Implemented in [`#75: smol option`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/75)
* Update MSRV to 1.57.

# 0.4
### May 27, 2022
* Rename `CompactStr` -> `CompactString` and `ToCompactStr` -> `ToComapctString`
    * Implemented in [`#97 refactor: Rename CompactStr to CompactString`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/95)
* Improve performance of `ToCompactStr` by reducing copies for some specialized types
    * Implemented in [`#95 perf: Reduce copies in ToCompactStr for integer types`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/95)
* Introduce the `ToCompactStr` trait, with specialized impls for common types
    * Implemented in [`#16 Add && Impl new trait ToCompactStr`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/16)
* Improve the performance of `From<Cow<'_, str>>`
    * Implemented in [`#90 Optimize From<Cow<'a, str>> impl for CompactStr`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/90)
* impl various `Add<T>` for `CompactStr`, enabling concatination with `+`
    Implemented in [`#81 impl a bunch of Add<T>s for CompactStr, and Add<CompactStr> for String`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/81)
* Improved the performance of `Drop` for inlined strings
    * Implemented in [`#78 perf: Improve the performance of Repr::Drop for Inlined Variants`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/78)
* impl `fmt::Write` for `CompactStr`
    * Implemented in [`#73 Implement fmt::Write for CompactStr`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/73)
* Inline short heap strings when resizing. After enabling `O(1)` conversion from `String` and `Box<str>` it became possible for short strings to be heap allocated. Now if we need to resize a short heap string, we'll inline it, instead of re-heap allocating.
    * Implemented in [`#70 perf: Inline short heap strings when resizing`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/70)

# 0.3.2
### March 27, 2022
* Enable `O(1)` conversion from `String` or `Box<str>` to `CompactStr`
    * Implemented in [`#65 perf: Move Capacity onto the Stack`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/65)
* Update the README to remove references to "immutable". `CompactStr` became mutable with `v0.3.0`

# 0.3.1
### March 6, 2022
* impl `Extend<Cow<str>>` for `CompactStr`
    * Implemented in [`#64 feature: impl Extend<Cow<'_, str>> for CompactStr`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/64)
* impl `From<Cow<str>>` for `CompactStr`
    * Implemented in [`#62 impl From<Cow<'_, str>> for CompactStr`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/62)

# 0.3.0
### February 27, 2022
* Add `CompactStr::from_utf8(...)` API
    * Implemented in [`#57 feature: Add from_utf8 API`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/57)
* Changed the heap variant from an atomically reference counted string, to a normal heap allocated string
    * Implenented in [`#56 feature: BoxString`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/56)
    * Note: This change was made after much deliberation and research into C++ strings and the performance of "copy on write" once mutation is introduced
* Combined the Inline and Packed variants into one variant, store the discriminant in the last byte instead of first
    * Implemented in [`#49 refactor: Combine Inline and Packed Variants`](https://github.com/ParkMyCar/compact_str/pull/49)
    * Note: This simplified the code, and improved the performance of inline string creation and modification
